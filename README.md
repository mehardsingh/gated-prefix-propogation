# prefix-tuning
The plan.md file provides a high-level plan for our exploration.

Hugging Face trainer compatable model class files for BERT and Roberta for both vanilla prefix propagation and gated prefix propagation can be found in the trainer_compatible directory. This is what we used for training and testing. 

The actual training scripts can be found in train_multinli.ipynb, train_agnews.ipynb, and train_cola.ipynb.
